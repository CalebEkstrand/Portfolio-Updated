    <p>Hello, My name is caleb and I'm an aspiring web developer currently enrolled in Denver Universities full time web development course. I am 20 years old and I'm ready to make a positive impact on the world and work my way up. The thing I need most is the right company to give me a chance to learn and improve.</p>
    <p>I have always believed in working your absolute hardest and taking pride in your work. The person I have to thank for my excellent work ethic is my grandfather, who since I can remember would always have me help him on his projects and taught me the value of money by helping me start an aeration business when I was 12 and eventually I moved on to helping a family friend at his concrete lifting company when I was 14. I graduated from Arapahoe Ridge High School when I was only 16 and became the youngest manager ever for a chain of 12 pizza stores based in Denver by the time I was 18.</p>
    <p>I know I still have so much to learn, especially about JavaScript, So if you are willing to hire a hardworking individual willing to learn please get in contact with me through my contact page.</p>
