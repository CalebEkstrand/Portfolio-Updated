# Portfolio-Updated
I worked really hard on this portfolio to make it look its absoulute best, I used skeleton for the css and added some animation to the logos on the contact page. That was probably the hardest part. Other than that skeleton made it pretty easy and fun. I also made my personal logo in photoshop.
